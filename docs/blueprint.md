## Core Features:

- Sensor Data Visualization: Display real-time sensor data (ldr light brightness, humidity, temperature, water level, soil moisture and flame) in a dynamic, visually appealing radial knob/gauge format.
- Homepage Overview: Home page displays key alerts and an overview of connected devices and their status. Each sensor will display an emoji indicating its status.
- Collapsible Sidebar Navigation: Collapsible sidebar for easy navigation between app sections. Implemented using radix ui primitives.
- Device Control: Control two virtual light devices with on/off/auto modes, controllable from UI elements.
- Intelligent Alert System: AI-powered alert system that processes sensor data and generates alerts based on pre-defined thresholds for Soil Moisture (<10%), water shortage, and flame detection. An AI reasoning tool will incorporate historical data to predict and prevent potential issues.
- Dark/Light Mode: Implements both dark and light mode, user toggle-able switch which respects device preferences.
- Smooth Animations: Fluid animations for smooth transitions and enhanced user experience using Framer Motion.
